<h1>CSS Basics</h1>

<p>
CSS stands for cascading style sheets, CSS describes how html elements
are to be displayed on the screen, paper or on any other media.</p>
<p>CSS saves a lot of work, it can control the layout of multiple pages at
once.
External style sheets are stored in css files.

    CSS was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996 for a rather simple reason. HTML element was not designed to have tags that would help format the page. You were only supposed to write the markup for the web page.

    Tags like were introduced in HTML version 3.2, and it caused quite a lot of trouble for web developers. Due to the fact that web pages have different fonts, colored backgrounds, and multiple styles, it was a long, painful, and expensive process to rewrite the code. Thus, CSS was created by W3C to solve this problem.
    
    CSS is not technically a necessity, but you probably wouldn't want to look at a web page that features only HTML elements as it would look completely bare-boned.

<p><h1>CSS advantages on web pages</h1></p>
<p> 
    The difference between a web page that implements CSS and one that doesn't is massive and surely noticeable.

You might have seen a website that fails to load completely and has a white background color with most of the text being blue and black. This means that the CSS part of the web page didn't load correctly or it doesn't exist altogether.

That's what web pages with only HTML look like, and I think you'd agree that that's not very appealing.
Before using CSS, all of the stylizing had to be included into the HTML markup. This means web developers had to separately describe the background color, font size, alignments, etc.

CSS lets you stylize everything on a different file, thus creating the design there and later on integrating the CSS files on top of the HTML markup. This makes the actual HTML markup much cleaner and easier to maintain.

In short, with CSS features you don't need to repeatedly describe how individual elements look. This saves time, shortens the code, and makes it not as prone to errors.

CSS lets you have multiple styles on one HTML page, therefore making the customization possibilities almost endless. Nowadays, this is becoming more a necessity than a commodity.

<p><h1>How does CSS work</h1></p>
<p>CSS uses a simple English based syntax with a set of rules that govern it. Like we've mentioned before, HTML was never intended to use style elements, only the markup of the page. It was created to merely describe the content. For example: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>.

But how do you style the paragraph? The CSS syntax structure is pretty simple. It has a selector and a declaration block. You select an element and then declare what you want to do with it. Pretty straightforward, right?

However, there are rules you have to remember. The structure rules are pretty simple, so don't worry.

The selector points to the HTML elements you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>
